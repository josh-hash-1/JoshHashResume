    <h2>
        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am <em>Josh Hash</em> a student at Algonquin College in the Computer Engineering-Computer Science program. I am from a
        small town 40 minutes from Ottawa named Embrun, I grew up in this little town, lived and went to school there until
        the age of 15 when I moved to Ottawa.
    </p>    
    <p>
        I grew up playing sports, I played hockey, volley ball, soccer, football, mountain biking and many other sports. I grew up with parents who loved sports
        , they often were my coaches or trainer's when I was younger, they would also tell me 
        <blockquote>
            Life is too short to wonder "what if"â€”try everything and discover what makes you come alive. 
        </blockquote> 
        <p>
        The sport I played the most when I was younger was hockey I mostly played house league in my home town 
        <strong>
            winning many tournaments and a few final series over the years
        </strong>
        , on the side I would also be the substitute player for the competitive teams around Embrun.

            My Education
        </h2>
        <p>
            I started school in my hometown of Embrun, I stayed there until the end of nineth grade when I moved to Ottawa going to a trade school who started experimenting
            with a new program in gaming. I originaly was appart of theyre <abbr title="Electronic Sports">esports</abbr> teams participating in tournaments around Canada, as time went on I left the teams and
            started practicing Sim Racing, I was able to join a tournament in Montreal during my last year of high school. I starting switching my later gaming classes 
            to programming and science classes around the 11th grade. I graduated from high school with my billingual degree in 2024.
